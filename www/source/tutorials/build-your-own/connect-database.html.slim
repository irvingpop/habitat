title: Habitat - Connect to Database

section
 h1 Connect to Database

 p As part of the parsing logic of your Gemfile, the Ruby scaffolding detects any database gems that you have added to your Gemfile and will modify the default init hook and other web application setup scripts that it creates to provide a default, but customizable configuration behavior. The connection logic provided in the scaffolding also allows you to connect your web app to a database in a number of ways such as through containers, virtual machines, database cloud services, and so on. 
 
 p The Ruby scaffolding will set up this connection to logic for PostgreSQL databases assuming your Gemfile contains the following PostgreSQL database gems:

 ul
  li pg
  li activerecord-jdbcpostgresql-adapter
  li jdbc-postgres
  li jdbc-postgresql
  li jruby-pg
  li rjack-jdbc-postgres
  li tgbyte-activerecord-jdbcpostgresql-adapter

 h2 Setting database connection values

 p Connecting to the PostgreSQL database from Rails requires setting the database adapter value, user name, password, and host. If you use the default init hook created by the Ruby scaffolding, and also referenced a PostgreSQL gem in your Gemfile, the Ruby scaffolding will create an init hook that will attempt to connect to any database you bind to. By default, the PostgreSQL database package exposes its port value and root-level username and password values. 

 p In the <code>habitat</code> directory inside your project repo, edit the <code>default.toml</code> to set the correct database connection information.

 pre
  code
   |
    [db]
    user = "admin"
    password = "admin"

 p By default, the Ruby scaffolding sets both the Rails and Rack environment variables to 'production'. If you want to override either value, add the following to your <code>default.toml</code>:

 pre
  code
   |
    rails_env|rack_env = "development|test"

 p Also, by default, because the <code>RAILS_ENV</code> is set to 'production', the database name that the scaffolding will try to connect to will be named <i>package_</i>production. If you want to override that value, add the following in the <code>db</code> TOML table:

 pre
  code 
   |
    name = "databasename"

 p Now that you have your basic connection settings, you can proceed with connecting your web app to PostgreSQL running in a container, in VMs, or in the cloud.

 h2 Connecting to a database running inside a Docker container

 p This is the easiest scenario and useful for local testing of service binding between your database package. Assuming you are connecting to a PostgreSQL database, export the <code>core/postgresql</code> package to a Docker container as you did for your web application.

 pre
  code $ hab studio enter

 pre
  code # hab pkg export docker core/postgresql && exit

 p Once you've created Docker containers for both your web application and the PostgreSQL database package, you can either open two terminal windows and start them up via <code>docker run</code> commands, or use Docker Compose to start them up together. 

 h3 Using containers directly

 p If you want to run the Docker containers directly, open two terminal windows and run the following:

 pre
  code $ docker run -it core/postgresql

 pre
  code $ docker run -it <origin>/<package> --peer <DB_IP_ADDRESS> --bind database:postgresql.default

 p The example above requires that you get the IPv4 address of the running PostgreSQL container, which you can retrieve by using the <code>docker inspect</code> command.

 pre
  code $ docker inspect CONTAINERID | grep "IPAddress"

 h3 Using Docker Compose

 p The other option is to use a tool such as Docker Compose to bring up both services. The <code>docker-compose.yml</code> used in the #{link_to 'Run the Sample App', 'https://www.habitat.sh/tutorials/sample-app/mac/run-app/'} step of the Build a Sample App tutorial can be modified and used for your iterative development needs.

 p Create a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> to bring up both your web application and database containers. The volume being shared assumes that you place the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> at the root of your local project repo. 
 
 p Replace <code>origin/package</code> with the values for your web app.

 pre
  code.yaml
   | 
     version: '3'
     services:
       db:
         image: core/postgresql
         volumes:
           - "./habitat/default.toml:/default.toml"
       railsapp:
           image: origin/package
           ports:
             - 8000:8000
           links:
           - db
           command: --peer db --bind database:postgresql.default

 p The next step is to bring up the containers.

 pre
  code $ docker-compose up

 p As the Habitat packages initialize, you should see an error in the output that specifies that your web application cannot connect to the database container. This is because the particular database specified by your web application (<code>yourapp_production</code>) has not been set up, so you will need to do this manually. The credentials you provided in your <code>habitat/default.toml</code> file will give you the permission to do this when running the following command:

 pre
  code $ docker-compose exec yourapp yourapp-rake db:setup

 p Your Rails app and database should now be up and running in Docker containers. You can validate this on your local workstation by browsing to https://localhost:8000/someendpoint. 

 h2 Connecting to a PostgreSQL cluster running in VMs

 p If you need to run your own PostgreSQL cluster, this section will show you how to do so by running the <code>core/postgresql</code> Habitat package directly on a series of virtual machines.

 blockquote
  p <b>Note</b> This section does not specify where your virtual machines are running; however, these instructions should be applicable whether you are running on-prem or in the cloud.

 p Part of running the cluster is to set up a leader-follower topology where interactions between your web app and the database cluster happen primarily on a leader node with replication activities happening on follower nodes.

 p Habitat has built-in support for leader-follower topology, so functions like leader election will be done with minimal effort from you.

 p The first step is to install the Habitat CLI onto each machine and then add the <code>hab</code> user and group to the machine. Because currently most Habitat packages run in Linux environments natively, each of your machines should be running a Linux distributon with the kernel greater than or equal to 2.6.32.

 pre
  code
   |
    $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/habitat-sh/habitat/master/components/hab/install.sh | sudo bash
    $ sudo groupadd hab
    $ sudo useradd -g hab hab

 p Now, in one of these three instances, run the following command to both install <code>core/postgresql</code> and start a supervisor ring

 pre
  code $ sudo hab start core/postgresql --topology leader --group production

 p Then, in each of the other two instances, run this command:

 pre
  code $ sudo hab start core/postgresql --topology leader --group production --peer first_instance_public_ip_address

 p This will connect them with the first instance and create a supervisor ring. When all three are up, you will see them hold an election and select a leader.

 p To connect your web app to the cluster, you need to know which instance is the leader, and the leader ID might be difficult to find. Fortunately, there is a way to look it up.

 p Pick the public IP of one of those three instances then head to your browser and navigate to http://your_instance_public_ip:9631/census.

 p Search for the id of the leader. That will bring you to information about that particular supervisor. Look for the ip address - this is the private IP of the instance that is the leader.

 p Now, match that private IP to one of your instances and then copy the public IP of that instance.

 p Open up <code>habitat/default.toml</code> and replace the value for the <code>host</code> key with that public ip address. 
 
 blockquote
  p <b>Note</b>It does need to be the public ip of the leader in order to work.

 pre
  code
   |
    [db]
    user = "admin"
    password = "admin"
    host = "leader_public_ip_address"

 p Now re-enter back the studio, build your package again, and then export that new package into a docker image.

 pre
  code
   |
    $ hab studio enter
    # build
    # hab pkg export docker origin/package && exit

 p Run the docker container for your web app.

 pre
  code $ docker run -it -p 8000:8000 origin/package

 p As part of the general workflow of using your rails app, you need to setup the database from your web app container. 

 pre
  code $ docker exec -it CONTAINERID yourapp-rake db:setup

 p Once this successfully completes, head back to your browser, navigate to https://localhost:8000/someendpoint to view your web app connected to a PostgreSQL cluster.

 h2 Connecting to an Amazon RDS Database

 p Cloud database services like Amazon RDS can also be used with your web app. Because the Ruby scaffolding has built-in support for PostgreSQL, the first step you need to take is to #{link_to 'create a PostgreSQL DB instance', 'http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_GettingStarted.CreatingConnecting.PostgreSQL.html#CHAP_GettingStarted.Creating.PostgreSQL'} in RDS.

 p Default values are fine, but make sure to note what you set these two values as:

 pre
  code
   |
    master username
    master password

 p RDS instances can sometimes take awhile to spin up. Wait until it is ready before moving onto the next instructions.

 p Once the RDS instance is up, update the <code>habitat/default.toml</code> file in your local project repo.

 p Modify it so that the <code>db.user</code> matches the username you set for your RDS instance and the <code>db.password</code> matches the password you set for your RDS instance. Finally, you also need to add in <code>db.host</code> and set it to the endpoint for your RDS instance (you can get this from the AWS GUI or cli). Do not include the port number in the endpoint. The value should be "https://my_endpoint" not "https://my_endpoint:5432". 

 pre
  code
   |
    [db]
    user = "rds_instance_username"
    password = "rds_instance_password"
    host = "rds_endpoint_without_port"

 p Save <code>habitat/default.toml</code>, re-enter the studio, build your package, and export that newly built package as a Docker image.

 pre
  code
   |
    $ hab studio enter
    # build
    # hab pkg export docker origin/package && exit

 p Because you're not interacting with another Habitat package as in the previous section, you do not need to set the service binding or join a ring with another service. Simply run the Docker container for your web app and set an exposed port so you can browse to your web app from your local workstation
 
 pre
  code $ docker run -it -p 8000:8000 origin/package

 p And just as in the previous section, you need to setup the database from your web app container. 

 pre
  code $ docker exec -it CONTAINERID yourapp-rake db:setup

 p Once this runs, head back to your browser, navigate to https://localhost:8000/someendpoint to see your web app up and running connected to an RDS DB instance.
